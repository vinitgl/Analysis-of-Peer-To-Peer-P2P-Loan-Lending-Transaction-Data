# Analysis-of-Peer-To-Peer-P2P-Loan-Lending-Transaction-Data

The objective is to analyze P2P Lending loan transaction data from one of major US market player for over a decade and build model for 
identification and recommendation of borrowers/loan for an investor. Overall, we will have the effort in below themes
●	Predict the interest rate of potential lenders
●	Predict the probability of default for a potential loan.

The exercise is to build model for potential (individual) investors, to diversify and advise for best possible loan funding options. 
This will enable them to efficiently leverage the P2P Lending platform for optimal ROI.
The dataset consists of 144 variables and records of 42535 borrowers. 


Problem Statements:
●	To predict the interest rate of potential lenders

-	The Column name  ”int_rate” can be a potential Target column for predicting the interest rate at which investors can provide loans to 
the borrowers.

•	To predict the probability of default for a potential loan

-	The column “ loan_status” can be used as a Target column for predicting whether the borrower will default the loan or not. 
It appears to be a binary classification problem where the target variables contains two classes:

I.	Fully paid
II.	Charged off
